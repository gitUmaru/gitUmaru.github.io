# Transcriptional activity is the default state of eukaryotic DNA

## Part 1: The Random Genome Project
### Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA)
- Eukaryoes from yeast to human express non-coding RNAs
- Polyadenylated, often spliced, often cell type-specifi expression, lowly expressed, poorly conserved
- We know that these non coding RNAs are having some functional effect (e.g. HOTAIR, XIST)
	- Lots of other ones with no **known** functions
	- Debate that some or all of these **are** *functional*

### Controversy over function in the human genome
- ENCODE, 2012: Found **biochemical functions for 80% of the genome**
	- Function defined as "if alteration then effect on fittness of organism"
- Graur, 2017: But protein encoding portion of genome is <1%

### Enter Random Genome and ENCODE project
#### Consider Yeast and Humans
- Both eukaryotes
- Both have lncRNAs

But they have distinct lifestyles and abilities to fix mutations due to effective population sizes

#### deBoer Lab Approach

## Part 2: Transcription is the default state of the genome
### Random DNA has diverse expression in yeast
- You can get very diverse expression libraries using randome sequences
- Using **Yeast Aritifical Chromosomes as a source of evolutionarily naive DNA**
- Used for seq in human genome
	- 1MB of human DNA already in yeast
- Human and yest
	- Both euk
	- ~1 billion years of evolution seperated
	- Few TFs conserved
	- Distinct gene regulatory structure

- Analysis Approach: Compare expression of endogenous yeast genome to YAC-human hybrid genome chr7
- Naive DNA is transcribed *extensively*
	- Produces gene-like transcripts
	- Has more antisense expression
- Endogenous DNA has evolved a coherent gene structure

**Only sequenced polyA RNA**

$$ \nabla \times F = \frac{\partial F}{\partial \vec{x}} \hat{i} $$

							<p class="double-text">So this project was a submission for nwHacks 2020, which is one of the most popular and largest hackathon on the west coast. After find a team through the nwHacks 2020 slack channels we had a very brief brain storming session. The initial idea was to take facial input and generate computational artwork based on that. However, this quickly evolved into a very soft means of anxiety therapy.</p>

              <p class="center">Figure 1. Dashboard page of the web app (front end dev did really good job)</p>

							<p class="double-text">Basically, we used google cloud as our web app deploying service, and we also used their google vision API, in order to recognize emotions in a users face. The user would take a photo of their face in the brower and it automatically submits it to our API. Which we then process and generate a specific js animation based off of that. The entire thing was built in Django which was pretty hard to learn as we went along, however the challenge was appreciated.</p>

              <p class="center">Figure 2. Just fixed API integration issue, showing proof of concept</p>

              <p class="double-text">Some other feaures that we added were: A calming music playlist, a chat bot (so you have someone to talk to), and a button that locates mental health clinics as well as other imporant resources that are close to you</p>

              <p class="center">Figure 3. Example of the music page</p>

              <p class="double-text">Solid project all around, I'm really glad I did it. I enjoyed the project, especially considering that this was my first hackathon. I'm looking foreword to the next hackathon that I get to compete in.</p>
              <p class="double-text">Code and Documentation on Github, and Devpost under "Chill Calm" for nwHacks 2020</p>

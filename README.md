# gitUmaru.github.io


## umarali.ca
This github repo is the source code for my personal website, umarali.ca. The actaul website design was adopted by HTML5up, they do really good work, and I tweaked very minor things and added a few elements ontop of it.

## Motivation
The website is meant to act as a sort of portfolio for some the work that I have done over time. It highlights a lot of projects that I am really proud of.

## Setup
1. Create new github repo on online website
2. Name it USER_NAME.github.io
3. Open git Bash
4. Pull your own github repo
  ```
    git pull github.com/USER_NAME/USER_NAME.github.io
  ```
5. Clone mine
  ```
    git clone github.com/gitUmaru/gitUmaru.github.io
  ```
6. Make changes to website, commit and push
7. If you want custom domain name, add it to the CNAME file. Disclaimer, one thing to note about this is that you also have to setup SSL yourself.

## How to use?
The website is a static webpage, meaning that the pages are not generated dynamically so theres no back-end, per se, for the user to setup. However, one can look at github's electron and Jekyll documentation to get a better understanding of the backend that Github Pages offer.

## Credits
The webpage was designed by HTML5up, <a href="html5up.net">Here.</a>

## umarali.ca
This github repo is the source code for my personal website, umarali.ca. The actaul website design was adopted by HTML5up, they do really good work, and I tweaked very minor things and added a few elements ontop of it.

## Motivation
The website is meant to act as a sort of portfolio for some the work that I have done over time. It highlights a lot of projects that I am really proud of.

## Tech/framework used
Built with:
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [HTML5Up](https://html5up.net/)
- [GetForm.io](http://getforms.io/)


## Setup
1. Create new github repo on online website
2. Name it USER_NAME.github.io
3. Open git Bash
4. Pull your own github repo
  ```
    git pull github.com/USER_NAME/USER_NAME.github.io
  ```
5. Clone mine

    git clone github.com/gitUmaru/gitUmaru.github.io
  ```

  ```
  git add .
  ```
  ```
  git commit -m "COMMIT_MESSAGE"
  ```
  ```
  git push origin master
  ```

## How to use?
The website is a static webpage, meaning that the pages are not generated dynamically so theres no back-end, per se, for the user to setup. However, one can look at github's electron and Jekyll documentation to get a better understanding for that.

## Credits
The webpage was designed by HTML5up, I really liked the Hyperspace template they provided so under fair use I am using it for a personal website.

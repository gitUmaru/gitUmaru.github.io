                  <p> One my of friends (who shall remain nameless) often sleeps in class, largely due to his late night "studying" habits. On one ocassion he fell asleep during a study session of ours, however instead of drawing on his face; I used his face as a basis for a machine learning model that could detect when he was sleeping.</p>

									<h2 class="tooltip">3D Printed Prosthetic Limb<span class="tooltiptext">Complete</span></h2>
									<p>My friend and I had designed and built a 3d printed prosthetic limb that was controlled by the user's muscle input via an EMG. The raw frequency data was taken in as an analog value and coordinated with several servos which would pull on fishing wire to move the arm. This project won us: Silver in the South fraser Regional Science Fair 2019, Engineers and Geoscientists of BC Award, and BC Game Developers and Innovation Award</p>

									<p>One of my close friend and I had decided to build a magnetic railway to propell a payload with ferrous magnets attached. The railway consisted of alternating polarity of solenoids (as to change directions via computer systems). Furthermore, I had written a piece of software that would detect for colour using a computer vision library; this way I could scan for derailments.</p>

							<h2>Skills</h2>
							<p>In this very short section I hope to highlight what I believe some of skills are; this is really meant to track my progress of current skills I have, and skills that I want to eventually learn. </p>
							<div class="features">
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fab fa-code"></span>
									<h3>Python</h3>
									<p>If you have gone throught my project list then you might be aware that I semi-proficient in python. However, most of it IS spaghetti code that I hope to improve on. I have used python for: backend web developemnt (SHSS Grad App), computer vision (Panopitcon), machine learning (Is Johnny Sleeping), and even some small scripting (Vote Spam)</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fab fa-laptop"></span>
									<h3>C/C++ Programming</h3>
									<p>APSC 160 and my personal projects with Arduino have lead me down a path of lower level programming. I have used C for: all projects/assignments in APSC 160 (APSC 160), and all Arduino projects (Various) </p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fab fa-edit"></span>
									<h3>Adobe Photoshop/Illustrator</h3>
									<p>While this is not necessarilly a design portfolio, my skills with these tools are incredibly valuable as I spent a lot of time on developing them. This website banner was made in illustrator, and some photoshop examples are availble under Adobe</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fas fa-drafting-compass"></span>
									<h3>Autodesk CAD/Fusion 360</h3>
									<p>I have been using AutoCAD since grade 10, this has always been my favourite CAD software, I first fell in love when I took my school's drafting course. Projects that I have done that involved CAD are: House Plan, Crane Hook, and APSC 100 key chain (All of which are under CAD in projects)</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fas fa-code-branch"></span>
									<h3>Network</h3>
									<p>I have kind of used this word as an umbrella term for: git, ssh, and some menial service technician work. I use git for all my projects (even this website) and have developed a satisfactory level of efficiency with git. I use ssh to log into my desktop at home when I'm away on campus. I have also learned to repair CAT5 cables, as well as build a server with a team in a highschool course.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-user"></span>
									<h3>Playing Games With My Friends</h3>
									<p>Hold on, I know what your'e thinking, it is very cringy to list gaming as a skill, however I am not highlighting this as a skill (kinda I want to get better at games). Rather as a reminder/goal to remain social, I think this is critical to being approachable, likeable, and socially adequate. This is important to me as I am inherently introverted so being with people I enjoy being with helps with going outside my comfort zone.</p>
